<p>1) (Page 1) Bubble Chart and Horizontal Bar chart The first chart page shows Population of various prominent countries as a bubble chart where the bubble size is determined by the population (In Millions).To avoid text overflow, I have created a legend for all the countries on the left hand side whose population is being shown, hovering on a bubble shows a tooltip message with the population of these countries respectively. The second chart is a chart of GDP for these same countries (In Millions).</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>2) (Page 2 ) Vertical Bar chart filtered by country dropdown list where various filter criteria such as GDP QoQ, GDP YoY, Interest rate and Inflation_rate data can be viewed. If we hover on each bar visible, then color changes for these bars and we can also see the actual value for various economic indicators.</p>
